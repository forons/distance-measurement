# Distance Measurement

This project allows the user to measure the distance between two different datasets,
according to multiple distance metrics.

The user has to specify:
- the input of the path to the first dataset
- the input of the path to the second dataset

Moreover, she can define:
- the characteristics of the input dataset (header, quote representation, null representation)
- the columns that will be considered trough the measurement
